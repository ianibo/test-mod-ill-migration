This repository contains a legacy grails 6 application in the /legacy directory, and a target skeletal micronuat 4 application in the /mod-ill-mn directory. 

Using the legacy directory as a specification, migrate the following: 
  - grails domain classes for EACH of the comain classes found under /legacy/service/grails-app/domain/ to a micronaut data-jdbc @MappedEntity and a corresponding @JdbcRepository
  - liquibase migrations corresponding to all domain classes in the project found under /legacy/service/grails-app/migrations to an V1__initial_schema.sql migration suitable for use with flyway
